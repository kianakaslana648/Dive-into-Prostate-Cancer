### Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common non-dermatological cancer in the United States. Early diagnosis provides an opportunity for curative surgery. 
However, up to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy will relapse. The challenge is to identify those patients at risk for relapse and 
to better understand the molecular abnormalities that define tumors at risk for relapse.
Recently, genomic methodologies have been used to discover consistent gene expression patterns associated with a give histological or clinical phenotype.

### Background
Given detailed information of 6033 related gene expression levels and clinical diagnosis results of 102 patients, we tried to build a model which could predict
the diagnosis result from the gene expression levels and find the genes which are the most correlated ones to the diagnosis result.
